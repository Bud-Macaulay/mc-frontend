        The main implementation actions that are addressed within this grant
        are:
        <ul>
          <li>Providing research as open data</li>
          <li>
            Opening up an existing service to other participants, including
            international participants (including various disciplines like
            materials science, computational physics, computational chemistry)
          </li>
          <li>
            Combining existing services into a joint solution that is open to
            participants (by aiming to integrate with national and European
            existing services and networks)
          </li>
          <li>
            Testing and improving the quality of the services and further
            developing them (by implementing solid, robust and scalable
            technical solutions: monitoring, backups, autoscaling, ...)
          </li>
          <li>
            Expanding established, local solutions in research data management,
            data analysis and data evaluation (by providing DMP templates for
            researchers, also in collaboration with other projects funded by
            swissuniversities)
          </li>
          <li>
            Providing training modules for research data management and eScience
            (in the form of courses, tutorials, webinars)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

        The abstract of this grant, describing what Materials Cloud and AiiDA
        are, and outlining the aim of the project, follows:
      </p>

      <p>
        Materials Cloud is a web platform for Computational Open Science,
        conceived to assist Computational Scientists in the full life-cycle of
        their projects. In general, we can distinguish three types of data:
        social, harvested and noisy; experimental, harvested in controlled
        conditions; and computational, generated in controlled conditions.
        Materials Cloud focuses on the last type. As such it focuses on two
        essential components:

        <ul>
          <li>assist the researchers in the data generation part,</li>
          <li>
            track, visualize, and publish the controlled conditions under which
            the data was generated, i.e., record and share of the data
            provenance (the logical chain or, more precisely, graph of all input
            data and calculations that were used to produce the final result).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Based on these principles, the core of Materials Cloud is a data
          generation platform, strongly coupled with an archive and a sharing
          platform for open research data, assisting scientists in data
          dissemination, curation and publishing with DOIs. This sharing
          platform, thanks to a rich web interface, allows users to browse the
          data, navigate its provenance, visualize it, and download it for
          further reuse, making data fully accessible and interoperable. The
          platform is powered by our software framework
          <a href="http://www.aiida.net" target="_blank">AiiDA</a>, that
          provides automation of simulations, of workflows and a completely
          automated provenance tracking to ensure reusability and
          reproducibility of all computational research. Moreover, AiiDA has
          already a collection of plugins supporting over 20 simulation
          packages, and implementing various relevant scientific workflows.
          Thanks to the unique combination of features of AiiDA and Materials
          Cloud, our platform can ensure FAIR data sharing. Developed since 2015
          and public since December 2017, it already provides data on materials
          computed by over 100000 calculations. To our knowledge, currently no
          other infrastructure exists that is designed to guarantee the same
          level of reproducibility and FAIR sharing of the results in the field
          of Computational Materials Science, coupled with automation of
          simulations and workflows.

            <strong
              >The aim of this project is to scale up our Materials Cloud
              infrastructure to match the needs of the whole scientific
              community, in Switzerland first, extending then to Europe and
              beyond, while at the same time making sure that the infrastructure
              is stable, available at all times, flexible to support even more
              data types and scientific fields.</strong
            > In fact, while currently focused on Materials Science, the platform
            and the provenance model are very general and can be applied to many
            different disciplines, starting from computational physics and computational
            chemistry.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the 2021 extension, the efforts will be focused mostly on two
            components: the AiiDAlab simulation platform, and the Materials
            Cloud Archive for long-term storage of research data. Our aim is to
            match the needs of the whole scientific community, in Switzerland
            and beyond, and specifically targeting simulation laboratories that
            work in close collaboration with experimental researchers. At the
            same time, we want to ensure that the whole infrastructure is
            scalable, secure, and easy to redeploy on the (bare-metal or
            virtual) hardware of any university or research lab.
