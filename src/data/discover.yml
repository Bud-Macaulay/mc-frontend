            <p>This interactive dataset contains 2944 synthetically feasible donor-acceptor
            systems screened for intramolecular singlet fission capability. The computed
            properties of the dimer (excitation energies, singlet-triplet energy splitting,
            excited state character, dihedral angle between units) and of the constituent
            monomers (frontier molecular orbital energies,
            excitation energies, singlet-triplet energy splitting) are provided.
            The reader is invited to explore the interplay of these properties by choosing 
            the variables that are represented in the x, y, z and color axes. Clicking on a 
            point in the plot provides the DFT-optimized geometry and relevant properties for 
            that dimer alongside its SMILES string, which allows for rapid transferability 
            of the structure to other chemistry software. </p><p class="mt-2">Further information on methods,

            We screen a database of more than 69,000 hypothetical covalent organic frameworks (COFs)
            for carbon capture, using parasitic energy as a metric. In order to compute CO2-framework
            interactions in molecular simulations, we develop a genetic algorithm to tune the charge
            equilibration method and derive accurate framework partial charges. Nearly 400 COFs are
            identified with parasitic energy lower than that of an amine scrubbing process using
            monoethanolamine; over 70 are better performers than the best experimental COFs;
            and several perform similarly to Mg-MOF-74. We analyze the effect of pore topology
            on carbon capture performance in order to guide development of improved carbon capture materials.

          content: |
            <p>We present a database of <b>324,426 hypothetical Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs)</b>
            screened for potential carbon dioxide scrubbers. Using a method to assemble these
            materials with topological blueprints, we only selected materials that could be
            accurately represented with the MEPO-QEq charge generation method. By ensuring that the
            electrostatic potential is accurately represented in these materials, screening for CO2 
            adsorption properties should result in very few false positives/negatives. </p> 
            <p class="mt-2">Post-combustion flue gas was simulated at a temperature of both 298K and 0.15 bar CO2,
            and 313K and 0.15 bar CO2. Mixture adsorption was simulated with the conditions 298K and 
            0.15:0.85 CO2/N2 with a total pressure of 1 bar. We report working capacities, i.e. the 
            difference of adsorption of CO2 between two thermodynamic state points. 
            The adsorption state point(s) are mentioned above, and two desorption values were simulated;
            <p class="mt-2">0.1 bar CO2 at 363K (vacuum swing adsorption) and 0.7 bar CO2 at 413K (temperature swing adsorption). </p>
            Over <b>8,000 materials were selected for more refined simulations,</b> including re-defining partial atomic charges with
             the REPEAT method, and more detailed simulations to obtain common chemical patterns surrounding CO2 binding sites (adsorbaphores). </p>
            <p class="mt-2">The interactive figure allows to explore the full database of assembled structures,
            together with their properties. All structures and properties can be downloaded in bulk from the Materials Cloud archive entry linked above.</p>

          content: |
            Molecular simulations with periodic boundary conditions
            require to define a certain cutoff distance beyond which
            pairwise dispersion interactions are neglected. For the
            simulation of homogeneous phases it is well-established
            to use tail-corrections, that can remedy this truncation
            of the potential. These corrections are built under the 
            assumption that beyond the cutoff the radial distribution 
            function is equal to one. In this work we shed some light 
            on the discussion whether or not tail corrections should 
            be used in the modelling of heterogeneous systems. We show 
            that for the adsorption of gasses in a diverse set nanoporous 
            crystalline materials (zeolites, Covalent Organic Frameworks 
            (COFs), and Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs)), tail-corrections
            are an appropriate choice with which the results are much less
            sensitive to the details of the truncation.

            <p> We present sketch-maps for <b>25,112 catalysts</b>, categorized by metal type. 
            Each catalyst's name is expressed in the form metal_L1_L2 and is colored by the
            value of its energy-based descriptor (i.e., substrate binding energy) for different 
            cross-coupling reactions. The color code corresponds to the volcano plateau of the different reactions, 
            where black represents the plateau region for Suzuki coupling. 
            Green and red shades (see color bar) indicate catalysts with ideal thermodynamics 
            (i.e., species that fall of the plateau) for other cross-coupling reactions 
            (i.e., Kumada, Negishi, Stille, and Hiyama). Catalysts depicted in gray are not 
            ideal for any of the coupling reactions studied. </p>
            <p class="mt-2"> The chemical structures of the 91 ligands are available in the

            <p>We present <b>69,840 covalent organic frameworks</b>
            (COFs) assembled <i>in silico</i> from a set of 666 
            distinct organic linkers into 2D layers and 3D networks. 
            We investigate the feasibility of using these COFs for methane
            storage by using grand-canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations
            to calculate their deliverable capacities (DCs). </p>
            <p class="mt-2"> This interactive figure allows to explore the full
            database of assembled COF structures, together with their properties.
            All structures and properties can be downloaded in bulk from the
            Materials Cloud archive entry linked above. </p>

        The database contains the results of high-throughput first-principles screening

            <p> The database (version 0.1, 8-Aug-2018) contains 16705 unique entries, 
            of which 4482 compounds show non-trivial Z2 indices. Each entry contains 
            basic information about the materials, its crystal structure, Brillouin zone,
            calculated band structure, Wannier charge center plots (when available),
            and other data. </p>
            <p class="mt-2"> The crystal structures originate 
            from ICSD [1] and COD [2] databases subject to the following pre-screening filters: </p>
            <ul>
              <li> 20 atoms or fewer in the unit cell; </li>
              <li> even number of electrons per unit cell; </li>
              <li> no rare-earth elements. </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt-2">The first-principle calculations have been performed using the Quantum-ESPRESSO package [3]
            on experimental crystal structures without relaxation. 
            Our computational methodology relies on the PBE exchange-correlations functional, 
            pseudopotentials from the SSSP library [4], and take into account the spin-orbit coupling. 
            The Z2 indices have been calculated using either the parity analysis for the centrosymmetric materials,
            or the Z2Pack methodology [5] for noncentrosymmetric crystal structures. </p>
